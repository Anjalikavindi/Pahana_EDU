## üé® Design Patterns & Architecture

This project is built following established software design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and security.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) 

The application clearly separates its concerns:

- Model: The DAO (Data Access Object) classes and Bean classes handle data access and business logic.
- View: The JSP pages are responsible for the user interface.
- Controller: The Servlet classes manage user requests and orchestrate the flow between the Model and View.

### Data Access Object (DAO)

This pattern is used to abstract and centralize all database interactions. Each data entity (e.g., User, Customer, Item) has a corresponding DAO class that handles all CRUD operations, decoupling the business logic from the persistence layer.

### Singleton

The DBConnection.java utility class uses a static method getConnection() to provide a single, consistent point of access to the database connection. The database properties are loaded only once in the static initializer block.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema
This project uses a MySQL database to manage its data. The schema, named pahana_edu, is comprised of six tables: users and roles to handle authentication and authorization; customers and items for managing core retail entities; and bills and bill_items to record transactional data. The tables are carefully structured with foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity across the application.
